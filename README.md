Once inside our Atlas interface, in the left menu we will find a section called "Data services", inside this menu is Data API, which is where we will click to enter the API creation page.

## Create an API key  

Now that we have followed the link in the previous step, we must create the API, the first thing we must do is go to the right side of the page, where we will find a button that says "Create API Key". We must click on it.

The first step is to name the API Key.

Once the name is set, we must select the cluster, the database and the collection that we want to use in the API Key. We must also specify the programming language in which we want to get the data API, in our case Python.
